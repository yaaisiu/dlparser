# Project Description
This project aims to build a system for extracting structured data from unstructured sources using LangGraph and the Google Gemini API. The system should support agentic workflows with human-in-the-loop capabilities.

# Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: langchain, langgraph, google-generativeai
- API: Google Gemini API

# Application Structure
The application should consist of the following nodes in LangGraph:
1. Input Node: Receives unstructured text and user guidance.
2. Planning Node: Uses the Gemini API to generate an extraction plan.
3. Extraction Node: Executes the plan to extract structured data.
4. Presentation Node: Displays the extracted data for user review.
5. Feedback Node: Collects user feedback for refinements.
6. Decision Node: Determines the next step based on feedback.

# Human in the Loop
The system should support checkpointing to allow user intervention at key stages.

# Style Guidelines
- Use standard Python naming conventions.
- Ensure code is well-commented and readable.
- Follow best practices for error handling and API usage.
