# Structured Data Extraction with LangGraph

## Key Points

- Research suggests LangGraph, part of the LangChain ecosystem, is suitable for building agentic workflows to extract structured data from unstructured sources, with support for human-in-the-loop interactions.
- It seems likely that integrating the latest Google Gemini API with LangGraph via Python can enhance extraction capabilities, especially for text processing.
- The evidence leans toward using nodes and conditional edges in LangGraph to create iterative processes, allowing user guidance and feedback for refining data extraction.

## Overview

Creating a system to extract structured data from unstructured sources using LangGraph or similar systems, with the latest Google API, Python, agentic workflows, and human-in-the-loop, involves setting up a flexible, iterative process. This system can handle various unstructured data types, like text, and organize them into structured formats, such as JSON, with user guidance at key stages.

## Setup and Integration

First, install necessary packages like langchain, langgraph, and google-generativeai, and obtain a Google AI API key from Google AI Studio. Configure the API key in your Python environment to enable interaction with the Gemini API, which is ideal for advanced text and multimodal processing.

## Workflow Design

Use LangGraph to define nodes for different stages:

- **Input Node**: Receives the unstructured text and user guidance.
- **Planning Node**: Uses the Gemini API to generate an extraction plan based on the input.
- **Extraction Node**: Executes the plan to extract structured data.
- **Presentation Node**: Displays the extracted data for user review.
- **Feedback Node**: Collects user feedback for refinements.
- **Decision Node**: Determines the next step (e.g., refine plan, re-extract, or finish) based on feedback.

Connect these nodes with edges, including conditional edges, to allow the workflow to loop back for iterations, ensuring the system adapts to user needs.

## Human in the Loop

Implement human-in-the-loop by using checkpointing in LangGraph, which saves the state for resuming later, enabling users to intervene and guide the process at critical points, such as after data presentation.

## Unexpected Detail

An unexpected benefit is that LangGraph's support for checkpointing not only facilitates human intervention but also allows for time-travel debugging, which can be useful for analyzing and optimizing the extraction process over time.

## Survey Note: Detailed Research on Libraries, Methods, and Reusable Code Snippets for Structured Data Extraction

This section provides an in-depth exploration of using LangGraph and similar systems for extracting structured data from unstructured sources, integrating the latest Google API, Python, agentic workflows, and human-in-the-loop mechanisms. It includes detailed methodologies, library insights, and reusable code snippets for future development, ensuring a comprehensive understanding for implementation.

### Introduction to LangGraph and Agentic Workflows

LangGraph, developed by the LangChain team, is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with large language models (LLMs), particularly suited for agentic workflows. It extends LangChain's capabilities by introducing cyclical graphs, essential for agent-like behaviors where LLMs decide actions in loops. This is particularly useful for data extraction tasks, as it allows for iterative processing and decision-making based on intermediate results.

Research indicates that LangGraph is designed for complex, multi-agent systems, with features like state persistence and human-in-the-loop workflows, making it ideal for guided data extraction. For instance, it supports checkpointing, which enables saving and resuming state, crucial for human intervention. This aligns with the user's requirement for a system where they can guide the extraction process.

### Integration with the Latest Google API

The latest Google API relevant to this task, as of February 28, 2025, is the Gemini API, part of Google's generative AI offerings. The Gemini API, accessible via the google-generativeai Python package, supports multimodal use cases, including text processing, which is central to extracting structured data from unstructured text sources. It offers models like Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision, with capabilities for generating plans and extracting information based on prompts.

Integration with LangGraph is facilitated through LangChain's ChatGoogleGenerativeAI class, which allows seamless interaction with Gemini models. This integration is documented in resources like LangChain Google Integration, ensuring compatibility for building agentic workflows.

### Python and Library Dependencies

To implement this system, the following Python packages are essential:
- langchain: For building LLM applications.
- langgraph: For creating stateful, agentic workflows.
- google-generativeai: For accessing the Gemini API.

Installation is straightforward:

```bash
pip install langchain langgraph google-generativeai
```

Ensure to obtain an API key from Google AI Studio and configure it:

```python
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
```

### Methods for Data Extraction

The extraction process involves several steps, leveraging LangGraph's node-based architecture:

1. **Input Processing**: Receive unstructured text and user guidance, storing them in the graph's state.
2. **Planning**: Use the Gemini API to generate a plan for extraction, interpreting the guidance to identify required fields (e.g., title, date, entities).
3. **Extraction**: Execute the plan, using the Gemini API to parse the text and extract structured data, potentially in JSON format.
4. **Presentation**: Display the extracted data to the user for review.
5. **Feedback Collection**: Allow the user to provide feedback, such as corrections or additional guidance.
6. **Decision Making**: Use the Gemini API to decide the next step based on feedback, enabling iterative refinement.

This agentic workflow is supported by LangGraph's ability to define nodes as Python functions and connect them with edges, including conditional edges for dynamic flow control. For example, after feedback, the system can loop back to planning or extraction based on the decision.

### Human in the Loop and Checkpointing

Human-in-the-loop is implemented through checkpointing, a feature of LangGraph that persists the application's state. This allows pausing the workflow for user intervention, such as reviewing extracted data and providing feedback, then resuming from the saved state. This is particularly useful for ensuring accuracy in data extraction, as users can guide the process at key stages.

To enable checkpointing:

```python
from langgraph import Checkpointer

checkpointer = Checkpointer()
graph = Graph()
# Add nodes and edges as defined
graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

This setup ensures the state is saved, supporting human interaction and iterative improvements.

### Reusable Code Snippets

Below are reusable code snippets for building the system, covering node definitions, edge configurations, and graph compilation:

#### Node Definitions:

**Input Node:**

```python
from langgraph import Node

class InputNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        text = state.get("text")
        guidance = state.get("guidance")
        return state
```

**Plan Node:**

```python
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

class PlanNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        text = state.get("text")
        guidance = state.get("guidance")
        llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro")
        plan = llm.predict(f"Given the text: {text}, and the guidance: {guidance}, generate a plan to extract the required information.")
        state["plan"] = plan
        return state
```

**Extract Node:**

```python
class ExtractNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        text = state.get("text")
        plan = state.get("plan")
        llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro")
        extracted_data = llm.predict(f"Extract the required information from the text: {text}, based on the plan: {plan}.")
        state["extracted_data"] = extracted_data
        return state
```

**Present Node:**

```python
class PresentNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        extracted_data = state.get("extracted_data")
        print("Extracted Data:", extracted_data)
        return state
```

**Feedback Node:**

```python
class FeedbackNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        extracted_data = state.get("extracted_data")
        feedback = input(f"Review the extracted data: {extracted_data}. Provide feedback or corrections: ")
        state["feedback"] = feedback
        return state
```

**Decide Next Step Node:**

```python
class DecideNextStepNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        feedback = state.get("feedback")
        llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro")
        next_step = llm.predict(f"Given the feedback: {feedback}, decide the next step. Options are: 'refine plan', 're-extract data', or 'finish'.")
        state["next_step"] = next_step
        return state
```

def condition_finish(state):
    return state.get("next_step") == "finish"

edge_input_to_plan = Edge(from_node=InputNode, to_node=PlanNode)
edge_plan_to_extract = Edge(from_node=PlanNode, to_node=ExtractNode)
edge_extract_to_present = Edge(from_node=ExtractNode, to_node=PresentNode)
edge_present_to_feedback = Edge(from_node=PresentNode, to_node=FeedbackNode)
edge_feedback_to_decide = Edge(from_node=FeedbackNode, to_node=DecideNextStepNode)
edge_decide_to_plan = Edge(from_node=DecideNextStepNode, to_node=PlanNode, condition=condition_refine_plan)
edge_decide_to_extract = Edge(from_node=DecideNextStepNode, to_node=ExtractNode, condition=condition_re_extract_data)
edge_decide_to_finish = Edge(from_node=DecideNextStepNode, to_node=None, condition=condition_finish)
```

#### Graph Compilation and Execution:

graph.add_node(InputNode())
graph.add_node(PlanNode())
graph.add_node(ExtractNode())
graph.add_node(PresentNode())
graph.add_node(FeedbackNode())
graph.add_node(DecideNextStepNode())

graph.add_edge(edge_input_to_plan)
graph.add_edge(edge_plan_to_extract)
graph.add_edge(edge_extract_to_present)
graph.add_edge(edge_present_to_feedback)
graph.add_edge(edge_feedback_to_decide)
graph.add_edge(edge_decide_to_plan)
graph.add_edge(edge_decide_to_extract)
graph.add_edge(edge_decide_to_finish)

checkpointer = Checkpointer()
graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

state = {
    "text": "Your unstructured text here",
    "guidance": "Your extraction guidance here"
}
graph.run(state)
```
